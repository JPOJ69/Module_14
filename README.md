# Evaluation Report 
* From the two models that we observed we can learn and see clearly now that the SVC classifier model from  SKLean's support vector machine (SVM) learning method made a more profitable prediction. It made a prediction that mimicked the Actual Returns when observing the first graph. As for the Logistic Regression model we see that it follows in line until it makes a turn for the worst making it the least profitable compared to the actual returns.
